# CNN Model Comparison

Welcome to the CNN Model Comparison repository! This collection comprises four Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, each trained with distinct architectures:
- AlexNet
- VGG16
- ResNet50
- MobileNet

We've meticulously trained these models and evaluated their performance on a common benchmark dataset â€” the Flowers dataset. This repository is dedicated to assessing and comparing their effectiveness in tackling various image recognition tasks.
